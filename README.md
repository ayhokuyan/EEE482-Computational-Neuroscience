The assignment and project implementations for EEE482 course, Bilkent University.

## Coverage of the repository

### Homework 1
- Solving a system of linear equations.
- Inspecting reverse statistical inference, a case study of Broca's are and engaging in language related cognitive activities.
- Implemented in Python (Jupyter Notebook)

### Homework 2
- Calculation and Inference of Spike Triggered Average (STA) Images.
- Simulation of Lateral Geniculate Nuclei (LGN) and V1 Simple Cell Neuron receptive fields using Gaussian and Gabor filters.  
- Implemented in Python (Jupyter Notebook)

### Homework 3
- Building Ridge and Linear Regression models to predict responses of a BOLD (Blood Oxygen Level Dependent) neural population. 
- Using Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals to determine the relationship between neural populations and their corresponding responses.
- Implemented in Python (Jupyter Notebook) 

### Homework 4
- Applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Non-negative Matric Factorization (NNMF) to represent face images and comparison of reconstruction quality.
- Applying probabilistic and non-probabilistic population decoding techniques (Winner-Takes-All (WTA), Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) and Maximum Likelihood (MLE)) given Gaussian-shaped tuning curves.
- Implemented in Python (Jupyter Notebook) 

###  Project:
- Using Haxby dataset for MVPA (Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis) to classify objects given fMRI data of subjects. 
- Used techniques are
	- kNN
	- SVM
	- Naive Bayes
	- MLP 
	- Logistic Regression
	- Random Forest and
	- Adaboost
	- Also worked on CNNs and 3D CNNs, but the results couldn't be presented due to the lacking computational resources.
